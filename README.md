### Personal Portfolio Website

*Oct 15, 2020*

Portfolio website of my personal brand and all the amazing work I have created. 

### Reason for Application
This project was designed for **Interactive Media Design** at **Fanshawe College**

Purpose is to create a full live-hosted website to demonstate the ability to host a website.  Data needs to be fetched from a database.

### Data for Portfolio
The file `PortfolioContent.json` within the `data/` folder is a template of what a portfolio item will look like once retrieved from a database.  
*DO NOT USE THIS AS PORFOLIO DATA IN FINISHED PRODUCT*
